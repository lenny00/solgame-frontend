## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview

✅ **Mint a Game Pass NFT (0.2 SOL)** to enter.  
✅ Play **6 on-chain elimination rounds** over **6 weeks**.  
✅ **Each round lasts 1 week**, so you can play **whenever you want** within that window (no need to be online at a specific hour).  
✅ Survive all 6 rounds to **win the jackpot**.

If you wish to exit, **you can resell your Game Pass NFT anytime on secondary markets such as Magic Eden** (each NFT has a Status attribute showing whether the player is Alive or Dead, and its image updates automatically to an “Eliminated” version when the player is out).
